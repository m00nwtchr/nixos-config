# How the image is parse, in order to get the colors:
#  * full       - Read and return the whole image pixels (more precision, slower)
#  * resized    - Resizes the image before parsing, mantaining it's aspect ratio
#  * wal        - Uses image magick `convert` to generate the colors, like pywal
#  * thumb      - Faster algo hardcoded to 512x512 (no ratio respected)
#  * fastresize - A much faster resize algo that uses SIMD. For some reason it
#                  fails on some images where `resized` doesn't, for this reason
#                  it does not *replace* but rather it's a new option.

# What color space to use to produce and select the most prominent colors:
#  * lab      - Uses Cie L*a*b color space
#  * labmixed - Variant of `lab` that mixes the colors gathered, if not enough
#                colors it fallbacks to usual lab (not recommended in small images)
#  * labfast  - Variant of `lab` that avoids floating arithmetic, thus, faster
#                operations but not that much precise result. Images that work on
#                lab/labmixed could not have "enough colors" for labfast.

# Difference between similar colors, used by the colorspace:
#  1          Not perceptible by human eyes.
#  1 - 2      Perceptible through close observation.
#  2 - 10     Perceptible at a glance.
#  11 - 49    Colors are more similar than opposite
#  100        Colors are exact opposite
#threshold = 20

# Use the most prominent colors in a way that makes sense, a scheme color palette:
# dark - dark16 - darkcomp - darkcomp16
# light - light16 - lightcomp - lightcomp16
# harddark - harddark16 - harddarkcomp - harddarkcomp16
# softdark - softdark16 - softdarkcomp - softdarkcomp16
# softlight - softlight16 - softlightcomp - softlightcomp16

# Ensures a "readable contrast" (OPTIONAL, disabled by default)
# Should only be enables when you notice an unreadable contrast frequently happening
# with your images. The reference color for the contrast is the background color.

# Color saturation, between [1% and 100%] (OPTIONAL, disabled by default)

# template: A relative path that points to a file where wallust.toml is located, usually at `~/.config/wallust/`.

# If one is a directory, the other one NEEDS to also be one, one line example below
